# Discourse
More than a label. With Discourse, we're aiming to promote constructive, non-partisan discussion. Each week a curated list
of current issues are added, and users can enter video debates to discuss these issues and engage with new perspectives.
Following each debate, users enter something relevant they learned from their discussion partner, and the most notable reflections
are archived in our issue database, chronicling a history of productive discussion.
We're not trying to change what people think, but rather how they approach politics on an issue-to-issue basis.
